# Readme-Generator

I have created a readme-generator to help developers create quality readme's based on the project they are currently working on.

I used NPM, Javascript, and JSon to accomplish this.

I used screencastify to record the video from chrome extensions.

The projects works by allowing developers to answer a set of questions about their project and then returns that info into a readme
so others who are reading the Readme file have a better understanding of the coding and project that is being presented.
